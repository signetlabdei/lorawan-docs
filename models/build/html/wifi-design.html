<p><em>ns-3</em> nodes can contain a collection of NetDevice objects, much like an actual
computer contains separate interface cards for Ethernet, Wifi, Bluetooth, etc.
This chapter describes the <em>ns-3</em> WifiNetDevice and related models. By adding
WifiNetDevice objects to <em>ns-3</em> nodes, one can create models of 802.11-based
infrastructure and ad hoc networks.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-the-model">
<h2>Overview of the model<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The WifiNetDevice models a wireless network interface controller based
on the IEEE 802.11 standard <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211" id="id1"><span>[ieee80211]</span></a>. We will go into more detail below but in brief,
<em>ns-3</em> provides models for these aspects of 802.11:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>basic 802.11 DCF with <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>adhoc</strong> modes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>802.11a</strong>, <strong>802.11b</strong>, <strong>802.11g</strong>, <strong>802.11n</strong> (both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands), <strong>802.11ac</strong> and <strong>802.11ax</strong> (both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands) physical layers</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MSDU aggregation</strong> and <strong>MPDU aggregation</strong> extensions of 802.11n, and both can be combined together (two-level aggregation)</p></li>
<li><p>QoS-based EDCA and queueing extensions of <strong>802.11e</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the ability to use different propagation loss models and propagation delay models,
please see the chapter on <a class="reference internal" href="propagation.html#propagation"><span class="std std-ref">Propagation</span></a> for more detail</p></li>
<li><p>various rate control algorithms including <strong>Aarf, Arf, Cara, Onoe, Rraa,
ConstantRate, and Minstrel</strong></p></li>
<li><p>802.11s (mesh), described in another chapter</p></li>
<li><p>802.11p and WAVE (vehicular), described in another chapter</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The set of 802.11 models provided in <em>ns-3</em> attempts to provide an accurate
MAC-level implementation of the 802.11 specification and to provide a
packet-level abstraction of the PHY-level for different PHYs, corresponding to
802.11a/b/e/g/n/ac/ax specifications.</p>
<p>In <em>ns-3</em>, nodes can have multiple WifiNetDevices on separate channels, and the
WifiNetDevice can coexist with other device types.
With the use of the <strong>SpectrumWifiPhy</strong> framework, one can also build scenarios
involving cross-channel interference or multiple wireless technologies on
a single channel.</p>
<p>The source code for the WifiNetDevice and its models lives in the directory
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/wifi</span></code>.</p>
<p>The implementation is modular and provides roughly three sublayers of models:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the <strong>PHY layer models</strong></p></li>
<li><p>the so-called <strong>MAC low models</strong>: they model functions such as medium
access (DCF and EDCA), RTS/CTS and ACK.  In <em>ns-3</em>, the lower-level MAC
is further subdivided into a <strong>MAC low</strong> and <strong>MAC middle</strong> sublayering,
with channel access grouped into the <strong>MAC middle</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>the so-called <strong>MAC high models</strong>: they implement non-time-critical processes
in Wifi such as the MAC-level beacon generation, probing, and association
state machines, and a set of <strong>Rate control algorithms</strong>.  In the literature,
this sublayer is sometimes called the <strong>upper MAC</strong> and consists of more
software-oriented implementations vs. time-critical hardware implementations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we provide an design overview of each layer, shown in
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wifi-architecture"><span class="std std-ref">WifiNetDevice architecture.</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="mac-high-models">
<h3>MAC high models<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-high-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are presently three <strong>MAC high models</strong> that provide for the three
(non-mesh; the mesh equivalent, which is a sibling of these with common
parent <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::RegularWifiMac</span></code>, is not discussed here) Wi-Fi topological
elements - Access Point (AP) (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::ApWifiMac</span></code>),
non-AP Station (STA) (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::StaWifiMac</span></code>), and STA in an Independent
Basic Service Set (IBSS) - also commonly referred to as an ad hoc
network (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::AdhocWifiMac</span></code>).</p>
<p>The simplest of these is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::AdhocWifiMac</span></code>, which implements a
Wi-Fi MAC that does not perform any kind of beacon generation,
probing, or association. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::StaWifiMac</span></code> class implements
an active probing and association state machine that handles automatic
re-association whenever too many beacons are missed. Finally,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::ApWifiMac</span></code> implements an AP that generates periodic
beacons, and that accepts every attempt to associate.</p>
<p>These three MAC high models share a common parent in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::RegularWifiMac</span></code>, which exposes, among other MAC
configuration, an attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QosSupported</span></code> that allows
configuration of 802.11e/WMM-style QoS support, an attribute
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HtSupported</span></code> that allows configuration of 802.11n High Throughput
style support, an attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VhtSupported</span></code> that allows configuration
of 802.11ac Very High Throughput style support and an attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HeSupported</span></code>
that allows configuration of 802.11ax High Efficiency style support.</p>
<p>There are also several <strong>rate control algorithms</strong> that can be used by the
MAC low layer.  A complete list of available rate control algorithms is
provided in a separate section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mac-low-layer">
<h3>MAC low layer<a class="headerlink" href="#mac-low-layer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>MAC low layer</strong> is split into three main components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::MacLow</span></code> which takes care of RTS/CTS/DATA/ACK transactions and also

<h3>PHY layer models<a class="headerlink" href="#phy-layer-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In short, the physical layer models are mainly responsible for modeling
the reception of packets and for tracking energy consumption.  There
are typically three main components to packet reception:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>each packet received is probabilistically evaluated for successful or
failed reception.  The probability depends on the modulation, on
the signal to noise (and interference) ratio for the packet, and on
the state of the physical layer (e.g. reception is not possible while
transmission or sleeping is taking place);</p></li>
<li><p>an object exists to track (bookkeeping) all received signals so that
the correct interference power for each packet can be computed when
a reception decision has to be made; and</p></li>
<li><p>one or more error models corresponding to the modulation and standard
are used to look up probability of successful reception.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>ns-3</em> offers users a choice between two physical layer models, with a
base interface defined in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::WifiPhy</span></code> class.  The YansWifiPhy
class has been the only physical layer model until recently; the model
implemented there is described in a paper entitled
<a class="reference external" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1190455.1190467?download=true">Yet Another Network Simulator</a>
The acronym <em>Yans</em> derives from this paper title.  The SpectrumWifiPhy
class is an alternative implementation based on the Spectrum framework
used for other <em>ns-3</em> wireless models.  Spectrum allows a fine-grained
frequency decomposition of the signal, and permits scenarios to
include multiple technologies coexisting on the same channel.</p>

<div class="section" id="scope-and-limitations">
<h2>Scope and Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-and-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The IEEE 802.11 standard <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211" id="id2"><span>[ieee80211]</span></a> is a large specification,
and not all aspects are covered by <em>ns-3</em>; the documentation of <em>ns-3</em>’s
conformance by itself would lead to a very long document.  This section
attempts to summarize compliance with the standard and with behavior
found in practice.</p>
<p>The physical layer and channel models operate on a per-packet basis, with
no frequency-selective propagation or interference effects when using
the default YansWifiPhy model.  Directional antennas are also not
supported at this time.  For additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
scenarios, or wideband interference scenarios, performance is governed
by the application of analytical models (based on modulation and factors
such as channel width) to the received signal-to-noise ratio, where noise
combines the effect of thermal noise and of interference from other Wi-Fi
packets.  Moreover, interference from other technologies is not modeled.
The following details pertain to the physical layer and channel models:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>802.11ax MU-OFDMA is not supported</p></li>
<li><p>802.11ax only supports SU PPDU format</p></li>
<li><p>802.11ac/ax MU-MIMO is not supported, and no more than 4 antennas can be configured</p></li>
<li><p>802.11n/ac/ax beamforming is not supported</p></li>
<li><p>802.11 HCF/HCCA are not implemented</p></li>
<li><p>802.11 PCF implementation currently assumes a DTIM interval equal to the beacon interval</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication and encryption are missing</p></li>
<li><p>Processing delays are not modeled</p></li>
<li><p>PHY_RXSTART is not supported</p></li>
<li><p>The current implementation assumes that secondary channels are always higher than primary channels</p></li>
<li><p>Cases where RTS/CTS and ACK are transmitted using HT/VHT/HE formats are not supported</p></li>
<li><p>Energy consumption model does not consider MIMO</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the MAC layer, most of the main functions found in deployed Wi-Fi
equipment for 802.11a/b/e/g/n/ac/ax are implemented, but there are scattered instances
where some limitations in the models exist. Support for 802.11n, ac and ax is evolving.</p>
<p>Some implementation choices that are not imposed by the standard are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>BSSBasicRateSet for 802.11b has been assumed to be 1-2 Mbit/s</p></li>
<li><p>BSSBasicRateSet for 802.11a/g has been assumed to be 6-12-24 Mbit/s</p></li>
<li><p>The wifi manager always selects the lowest basic rate for management frames.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Details<a class="headerlink" href="#design-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The remainder of this section is devoted to more in-depth design descriptions
of some of the Wi-Fi models.  Users interested in skipping to the section
on usage of the wifi module (User Documentation) may do so at this point.
We organize these more detailed sections from the bottom-up, in terms of
layering, by describing the channel and PHY models first, followed by
the MAC models.</p>
<p>We focus first on the choice between physical layer frameworks.  <em>ns-3</em>
contains support for a Wi-Fi-only physical layer model called YansWifiPhy
that offers no frequency-level decomposition of the signal.  For simulations
that involve only Wi-Fi signals on the Wi-Fi channel, and that do not
involve frequency-dependent propagation loss or fading models, the default
YansWifiPhy framework is a suitable choice.  For simulations involving
mixed technologies on the same channel, or frequency dependent effects,
the SpectrumWifiPhy is more appropriate.  The two frameworks are very
similarly configured.</p>
<p>The SpectrumWifiPhy framework uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Spectrum</span></code> channel
framework, which is not documented herein but in the Spectrum module
documentation.</p>
<p>The YansWifiChannel is the only concrete channel model class in
the <em>ns-3</em> wifi module.  The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiChannel</span></code> implementation uses the propagation loss and
delay models provided within the <em>ns-3</em> <a class="reference internal" href="propagation.html#propagation"><span class="std std-ref">Propagation</span></a> module.
In particular, a number of propagation models can be added (chained together,
if multiple loss models are added) to the channel object, and a propagation
delay model also added. Packets sent from a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiPhy</span></code> object
onto the channel with a particular signal power, are copied to all of the
other <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiPhy</span></code> objects after the signal power is reduced due
to the propagation loss model(s), and after a delay corresponding to
transmission (serialization) delay and propagation delay due to
any channel propagation delay model (typically due to speed-of-light
delay between the positions of the devices).</p>
<p>Only objects of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiPhy</span></code> may be attached to a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiChannel</span></code>; therefore, objects modeling other
(interfering) technologies such as LTE are not allowed.    Furthermore,
packets from different channels do not interact; if a channel is logically
configured for e.g. channels 5 and 6, the packets do not cause
adjacent channel interference (even if their channel numbers overlap).</p>
<div class="section" id="wifiphy-and-related-models">
<h3>WifiPhy and related models<a class="headerlink" href="#wifiphy-and-related-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::WifiPhy</span></code> is an abstract base class representing the 802.11
physical layer functions.  Packets passed to this object (via a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SendPacket()</span></code> method) are sent over a channel object, and
upon reception, the receiving PHY object decides (based on signal power
and interference) whether the packet was successful or not.  This class
also provides a number of callbacks for notifications of physical layer
events, exposes a notion of a state machine that can be monitored for
MAC-level processes such as carrier sense, and handles sleep/wake models
and energy consumption.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::WifiPhy</span></code> hooks to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::MacLow</span></code>
object in the WifiNetDevice.</p>
<p>There are currently two implementations of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy</span></code>: the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiPhy</span></code> and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy</span></code>.  They each work in
conjunction with three other objects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>WifiPhyStateHelper</strong>:  Maintains the PHY state machine</p></li>
<li><p><strong>InterferenceHelper</strong>:  Tracks all packets observed on the channel</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ErrorModel</strong>:  Computes a probability of error for a given SNR</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="yanswifiphy-and-wifiphystatehelper">
<h4>YansWifiPhy and WifiPhyStateHelper<a class="headerlink" href="#yanswifiphy-and-wifiphystatehelper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiPhy</span></code> is responsible for taking packets passed to
it from the MAC (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::MacLow</span></code> object) and sending them onto the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansWifiChannel</span></code> to which it is attached.  It is also responsible
to receive packets from that channel, and, if reception is deemed to have
been successful, to pass them up to the MAC.</p>
<p>The energy of the signal intended to be received is
calculated from the transmission power and adjusted based on the Tx gain
of the transmitter, Rx gain of the receiver, and any path loss propagation
model in effect.</p>
<p>Class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::WifiPhyStateHelper</span></code> manages the state machine of the PHY
layer, and allows other objects to hook as <em>listeners</em> to monitor PHY
state.  The main use of listeners is for the MAC layer to know when
the PHY is busy or not (for transmission and collision avoidance).</p>
<p>The PHY layer can be in one of six states:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>TX: the PHY is currently transmitting a signal on behalf of its associated
MAC</p></li>
<li><p>RX: the PHY is synchronized on a signal and is waiting until it has received
its last bit to forward it to the MAC.</p></li>
<li><p>IDLE: the PHY is not in the TX, RX, or CCA BUSY states.</p></li>
<li><p>CCA Busy: the PHY is not in TX or RX state but the measured energy is higher than the energy detection threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>SWITCHING: the PHY is switching channels.</p></li>
<li><p>SLEEP: the PHY is in a power save mode and cannot send nor receive frames.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Packet reception works as follows.  For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code>, most of the logic
is implemented in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy</span></code> base class.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiChannel</span></code> calls
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::StartReceivePreamble</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> to start packet reception, but first
there is a check of the packet’s notional signal power level against a
threshold value stored in the attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::RxSensitivity</span></code>.  Any
packet with a power lower than RxSensitivity will be dropped with no
further processing.  The default value is -101 dBm, which is the thermal
noise floor for 20 MHz signal at room temperature.  The purpose of this
attribute is two-fold:  1) very weak signals that will not affect the
outcome will otherwise consume simulation memory and event processing, so
they are discarded, and 2) this value can be adjusted upwards to function as
a basic carrier sense threshold limitation for experiments involving
spatial reuse considerations.  Users are cautioned about the behavior of
raising this threshold; namely, that all packets with power below this
threshold will be discarded upon reception.</p>
<p>In <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartReceivePreamble</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code>, the packet is immediately added
to the interference helper for signal-to-noise
tracking, and then further reception steps are decided upon the state of
the PHY.  In the case that the PHY is transmitting, for instance, the
packet will be dropped.  If the PHY is IDLE, or if the PHY is receiving and
an optional FrameCaptureModel is being used (and the packet is within
the capture window), then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::StartRx</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> is called next.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::StartRx</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> will typically schedule an event,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::StartReceiveHeader</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code>, to occur at
the notional end of the first OFDM symbol, to check whether the preamble
has been detected.  As of revisions to the model in ns-3.30, any state
machine transitions from IDLE state are suppressed until after the preamble
detection event.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartReceiveHeader</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> method will check, with a preamble detection
model, whether the signal is strong enough to be received, and if so,
an event <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::EndReceive</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> is scheduled for the end of reception,
and the PHY is put into the RX state.  Currently, there is only a
simple threshold-based preamble detection model in ns-3,
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ThresholdPreambleDetectionModel</span></code>.  If there is no preamble detection
model, the preamble is assumed to have been detected.
It is important to note that, starting with the ns-3.30 release, the default
in the WifiPhyHelper is to add the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ThresholdPreambleDetectionModel</span></code> with
a threshold RSSI of -82 dBm, and a threshold SNR of 4 dB.  Both the RSSI
and SNR must be above these respective values for the preamble to be
successfully detected.  The default sensitivity has been reduced in ns-3.30
compared with that of previous releases, so some packet receptions that were
previously successful will now fail on this check.  More details on the
modeling behind this change are provided in <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#lanante2019" id="id3"><span>[lanante2019]</span></a>.</p>
<p>In a real system, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndReceive</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> time would
not be determined until later when the PHY headers are successfully decoded,
but this ns-3 model has the available information at the start of the
packet to schedule this.  The second event to schedule is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartReceivePayload</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> for the time at which the PHY headers
have been received and the payload is about to start.</p>
<p>The next event at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StartReceivePayload</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> checks, using the interference
helper and error model, whether the header was successfully decoded, and if so,
a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PhyRxPayloadBegin</span></code> callback (equivalent to the PHY-RXSTART primitive)
is triggered.
The PHY header is often transmitted
at a lower modulation rate than is the payload.  The portion of the packet
corresponding to the PHY header is evaluated for probability of error
based on the observed SNR.  The InterferenceHelper object returns a value
for “probability of error (PER)” for this header based on the SNR that has
been tracked by the InterferenceHelper.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code> then draws
a random number from a uniform distribution and compares it against the
PER and decides success or failure.  The process is again repeated after
the payload has been received (possibly with a different error model
applied for the different modulation).  If both the header and payload
are successfully received, the packet is passed up to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MacLow</span></code> object.</p>
<p>If the header is determined to have errors, then a “PlcpSuccess” flag is
set for future reference, but the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndReceive</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> is not cancelled and
the PHY stays in RX state; upon the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EndReceive</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> event, the packet
will be considered errored in this case regardless of the payload reception,
based on the PlcpSuccess flag.</p>
<p>Even if packet objects received by the PHY are not part of the reception
process, they are tracked by the InterferenceHelper object for purposes
of SINR computation and making clear channel assessment decisions.
If, in the course of reception, a packet is errored or dropped due to
the PHY being in a state in which it cannot receive a packet, the packet
is added to the interference helper, and the aggregate of the energy of
all such signals is compared against an energy detection threshold to
determine whether the PHY should enter a CCA_BUSY state.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::CcaEdThreshold</span></code> attribute
corresponds to what the standard calls the “ED threshold” for CCA Mode 1.
In section 16.4.8.5 in the 802.11-2012 standard: “CCA Mode 1: Energy above
threshold. CCA shall report a busy medium upon detection of any energy above
the ED threshold.” By default, this value is set to the -62 dBm level specified
in the standard for 20 MHz channels. When using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code>, there are no
non-Wi-Fi signals, so it is unlikely that this attribute would play much of a
role in Yans wifi models if left at the default value, but if there is a strong
Wi-Fi signal that is not otherwise being received by the model, it has
the possibility to raise the CCA_BUSY while the overall energy exceeds
this threshold.</p>
<p>The above describes the case in which the packet is a single MPDU.  For
more recent Wi-Fi standards using MPDU aggregation, each individual MPDU
in the aggregate is sent as a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::Packet</span></code>, and the logic in
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy</span></code> is a bit different than the above for handling such
MPDUs (MPDUs after the first arrive without a preamble and header).</p>

<h4>InterferenceHelper<a class="headerlink" href="#interferencehelper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The InterferenceHelper is an object that tracks all incoming packets and
calculates probability of error values for packets being received, and
also evaluates whether energy on the channel rises above the CCA
threshold.</p>
<p>The basic operation of probability of error calculations is shown in Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#snir"><span class="std std-ref">SNIR function over time.</span></a>.  Packets are represented as bits (not symbols) in the <em>ns-3</em>
model, and the InterferenceHelper breaks the packet into one or more
“chunks”, each with a different signal to noise (and interference) ratio
(SNIR).  Each chunk is separately evaluated by asking for the probability
of error for a given number of bits from the error model in use.  The
InterferenceHelper builds an aggregate “probability of error” value
based on these chunks and their duration, and returns this back to
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code> for a reception decision.</p>

<p>From the SNIR function we can derive the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Packet
Error Rate (PER) for
the modulation and coding scheme being used for the transmission.</p>

<div class="section" id="errormodel">
<h4>ErrorModel<a class="headerlink" href="#errormodel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The error models are described in more detail in outside references.  Please refer to <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pei80211ofdm" id="id4"><span>[pei80211ofdm]</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pei80211b" id="id5"><span>[pei80211b]</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#lacage2006yans" id="id6"><span>[lacage2006yans]</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#haccoun" id="id7"><span>[Haccoun]</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#frenger" id="id8"><span>[Frenger]</span></a> for a detailed description of the available BER/PER models.</p>
<p>The current <em>ns-3</em> error rate models are for additive white gaussian
noise channels (AWGN) only; any potential fast fading effects are not modeled.</p>
<p>The original error rate model was called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansErrorRateModel</span></code> and
was based on analytical results.  For 802.11b modulations, the 1 Mbps mode
is based on DBPSK. BER is from equation 5.2-69 from <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#proakis2001" id="id9"><span>[proakis2001]</span></a>.
The 2 Mbps model is based on DQPSK. Equation 8 of <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ferrari2004" id="id10"><span>[ferrari2004]</span></a>.
More details are provided in <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#lacage2006yans" id="id11"><span>[lacage2006yans]</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::NistErrorRateModel</span></code> was later added and became the <em>ns-3</em> default.
The model was largely aligned with the previous <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansErrorRateModel</span></code>
for DSSS modulations 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps, but the 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps models
were re-based on equations (17) and (18) from <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pursley2009" id="id12"><span>[pursley2009]</span></a>.
For OFDM modulations, newer results were
obtained based on work previously done at NIST <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#miller2003" id="id13"><span>[miller2003]</span></a>.  The results
were also compared against the CMU wireless network emulator, and details
of the validation are provided in <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pei80211ofdm" id="id14"><span>[pei80211ofdm]</span></a>.  Since OFDM modes use
hard-decision of punctured codes, the coded BER is calculated using
Chernoff bounds.</p>
<p>The 802.11b model was split from the OFDM model when the NIST error rate
model was added, into a new model called DsssErrorRateModel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps models for 802.11b rely on library
methods implemented in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).  The Waf build
system tries to detect whether the host platform has GSL installed; if so,
it compiles in the newer models from <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pursley2009" id="id15"><span>[pursley2009]</span></a> for 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps;
if not, it uses a backup model derived from Matlab simulations.</p>
<p>As a result, there are three error models:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::DsssErrorRateModel</span></code>:  contains models for 802.11b modes.  The
802.11b 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps error models are based on classical modulation
analysis.  If GSL is installed, the 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps from
<a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#pursley2009" id="id16"><span>[pursley2009]</span></a> are used; otherwise, a backup Matlab model is used.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::NistErrorRateModel</span></code>: is the default for OFDM modes and reuses
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::DsssErrorRateModel</span></code> for 802.11b modes.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::YansErrorRateModel</span></code>: is the legacy for OFDM modes and reuses
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::DsssErrorRateModel</span></code> for 802.11b modes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Users should select either Nist or Yans models for OFDM (Nist is default),
and Dsss will be used in either case for 802.11b.</p>

<div class="section" id="spectrumwifiphy">
<h4>SpectrumWifiPhy<a class="headerlink" href="#spectrumwifiphy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This section describes the implementation of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpectrumWifiPhy</span></code>
class that can be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/wifi/model/spectrum-wifi-phy.{cc,h}</span></code>.</p>
<p>The implementation also makes use of additional classes found in the
same directory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wifi-spectrum-phy-interface.{cc,h}</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wifi-spectrum-signal-parameters.{cc,h}</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>and classes found in the spectrum module:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wifi-spectrum-value-helper.{cc,h}</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The current <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpectrumWifiPhy</span></code> class
reuses the existing interference manager and error rate models originally
built for YansWifiPhy, but allows, as a first step, foreign (non Wi-Fi)
signals to be treated as additive noise.</p>
<p>Two main changes were needed to adapt the Spectrum framework to Wi-Fi.
First, the physical layer must send signals compatible with the
Spectrum channel framework, and in particular, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultiModelSpectrumChannel</span></code> that allows signals from different
technologies to coexist.  Second, the InterferenceHelper must be
extended to support the insertion of non-Wi-Fi signals and to
add their received power to the noise, in the same way that
unintended Wi-Fi signals (perhaps from a different SSID or arriving
late from a hidden node) are added to the noise.</p>
<p>Unlike YansWifiPhy, where there are no foreign signals, CCA BUSY state
will be raised for foreign signals that are higher than CcaEdThreshold
(see section 16.4.8.5 in the 802.11-2012 standard for definition of
CCA Mode 1).  The attribute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::CcaEdThreshold</span></code> therefore
potentially plays a larger role in this model than in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code>
model.</p>
<p>To support the Spectrum channel, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YansWifiPhy</span></code> transmit and receive methods
were adapted to use the Spectrum channel API.  This required developing
a few <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpectrumModel</span></code>-related classes.  The class
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiSpectrumValueHelper</span></code> is used to create Wi-Fi signals with the
spectrum framework and spread their energy across the bands. The
spectrum is sub-divided into sub-bands (the width of an OFDM
subcarrier, which depends on the technology). The power allocated to a particular channel
is spread across the sub-bands roughly according to how power would
be allocated to sub-carriers. Adjacent channels are models by the use of
OFDM transmit spectrum masks as defined in the standards.</p>
<p>To support an easier user configuration experience, the existing
YansWifi helper classes (in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/wifi/helper</span></code>) were copied and
adapted to provide equivalent SpectrumWifi helper classes.</p>
<p>Finally, for reasons related to avoiding C++ multiple inheritance
issues, a small forwarding class called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiSpectrumPhyInterface</span></code>
was inserted as a shim between the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpectrumWifiPhy</span></code> and the
Spectrum channel.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiSpectrumPhyInterface</span></code> calls a different
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpectrumWifiPhy::StartRx</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> method to start the reception process.
This method performs the check of the signal power against the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::RxSensitivity</span></code> attribute and discards weak signals, and
also checks if the signal is a Wi-Fi signal; non-Wi-Fi signals are added
to the InterferenceHelper and can raise CCA_BUSY but are not further processed
in the reception chain.   After this point, valid Wi-Fi signals cause
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiPhy::StartReceivePreamble</span></code> to be called, and the processing continues
as described above.</p>

<h4>Infrastructure association<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-association" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Association in infrastructure mode is a high-level MAC function.
Either active probing or passive scanning is used (default is passive scan).
At the start of the simulation, Wi-Fi network devices configured as
STA will attempt to scan the channel. Depends on whether passive or active
scanning is selected, STA will attempt to gather beacons, or send a probe
request and gather probe responses until the respective timeout occurs. The
end result will be a list of candidate AP to associate to. STA will then try
to associate to the best AP (i.e., best SNR).</p>
<p>If association is rejected by the AP for some reason, the STA will try to
associate to the next best AP until the candidate list is exhausted which
then sends STA to ‘REFUSED’ state. If this occurs, the simulation user will
need to force reassociation retry in some way, perhaps by changing
configuration (i.e. the STA will not persistently try to associate upon a
refusal).</p>
<p>When associated, if the configuration is changed by the simulation user,
the STA will try to reassociate with the existing AP.</p>
<p>If the number of missed beacons exceeds the threshold, the STA will notify
the rest of the device that the link is down (association is lost) and
restart the scanning process. Note that this can also happen when an
association request fails without explicit refusal (i.e., the AP fails to
respond to association request).</p>

<div class="section" id="roaming">
<h4>Roaming<a class="headerlink" href="#roaming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Roaming at layer-2 (i.e. a STA migrates its association from one AP to
another) is not presently supported. Because of that, the Min/Max channel
dwelling time implementation as described by the IEEE 802.11 standard
<a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211" id="id17"><span>[ieee80211]</span></a> is also omitted, since it is only meaningful on the context
of channel roaming.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="channel-access">
<h4>Channel access<a class="headerlink" href="#channel-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function is used to calculate when to grant
access to the transmission medium. While implementing the DCF would have been
particularly easy if we had used a recurring timer that expired every slot, we
chose to use the method described in <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ji2004sslswn" id="id18"><span>[ji2004sslswn]</span></a>
where the backoff timer duration is lazily calculated whenever needed since it
is claimed to have much better performance than the simpler recurring timer
solution.</p>
<p>The DCF basic access is described in section 10.3.4.2 of <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211-2016" id="id19"><span>[ieee80211-2016]</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“A STA may transmit an MPDU when it is operating under the DCF access method
[..] when the STA determines that the medium is idle when a frame is queued
for transmission, and remains idle for a period of a DIFS, or an EIFS
(10.3.2.3.7) from the end of the immediately preceding medium-busy event,
whichever is the greater, and the backoff timer is zero. Otherwise the random
backoff procedure described in 10.3.4.3 shall be followed.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, a station is allowed not to invoke the backoff procedure if all of the
following conditions are met:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the medium is idle when a frame is queued for transmission</p></li>
<li><p>the medium remains idle until the most recent of these two events: a DIFS
from the time when the frame is queued for transmission; an EIFS from the
end of the immediately preceding medium-busy event (associated with the
reception of an erroneous frame)</p></li>
<li><p>the backoff timer is zero</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The backoff procedure of DCF is described in section 10.3.4.3 of <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211-2016" id="id20"><span>[ieee80211-2016]</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“A STA shall invoke the backoff procedure to transfer a frame
when finding the medium busy as indicated by either the physical or
virtual CS mechanism.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A backoff procedure shall be performed immediately after the end of
every transmission with the More Fragments bit set to 0 of an MPDU of
type Data, Management, or Control with subtype PS-Poll, even if no
additional transmissions are currently queued.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The EDCA backoff procedure is slightly different than the DCF backoff procedure
and is described in section 10.22.2.2 of <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211-2016" id="id21"><span>[ieee80211-2016]</span></a>. The backoff procedure
shall be invoked by an EDCAF when any of the following events occur:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a frame is “queued for transmission such that one of the transmit queues
associated with that AC has now become non-empty and any other transmit queues
associated with that AC are empty; the medium is busy on the primary channel”</p></li>
<li><p>“The transmission of the MPDU in the final PPDU transmitted by the TXOP holder
during the TXOP for that AC has completed and the TXNAV timer has expired, and
the AC was a primary AC”</p></li>
<li><p>“The transmission of an MPDU in the initial PPDU of a TXOP fails [..] and the
AC was a primary AC”</p></li>
<li><p>“The transmission attempt collides internally with another EDCAF of an AC that
has higher priority”</p></li>
<li><p>(optionally) “The transmission by the TXOP holder of an MPDU in a non-initial
PPDU of a TXOP fails”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, section 10.22.2.4 of <a class="reference internal" href="wifi-references.html#ieee80211-2016" id="id22"><span>[ieee80211-2016]</span></a> introduces the notion of
slot boundary, which basically occurs following SIFS + AIFSN * slotTime of idle
medium after the last busy medium that was the result of a reception of a frame
with a correct FCS or following EIFS - DIFS + AIFSN * slotTime + SIFS of idle
medium after the last indicated busy medium that was the result of a frame reception
that has resulted in FCS error, or following a slotTime of idle medium occurring
immediately after any of these conditions.</p>
<p>On these specific slot boundaries, each EDCAF shall make a determination to perform
one and only one of the following functions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decrement the backoff timer.</p></li>
<li><p>Initiate the transmission of a frame exchange sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>Invoke the backoff procedure due to an internal collision.</p></li>
<li><p>Do nothing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, if an EDCAF decrements its backoff timer on a given slot boundary and, as
a result, the backoff timer has a zero value, the EDCAF cannot immediately
transmit, but it has to wait for another slotTime of idle medium before transmission
can start.</p>
<p>The higher-level MAC functions are implemented in a set of other C++ classes and
deal with:</p>

<li><p>packet fragmentation and defragmentation,</p></li>
<li><p>use of the RTS/CTS protocol,</p></li>

<h4>ConstantRateWifiManager<a class="headerlink" href="#constantratewifimanager" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The constant rate control algorithm always uses the same
transmission mode for every packet. Users can set a desired
‘DataMode’ for all ‘unicast’ packets and ‘ControlMode’ for all
‘request’ control packets (e.g. RTS).</p>
<p>To specify different data mode for non-unicast packets, users
must set the ‘NonUnicastMode’ attribute of the
WifiRemoteStationManager.  Otherwise, WifiRemoteStationManager
will use a mode with the lowest rate for non-unicast packets.</p>
<p>The 802.11 standard is quite clear on the rules for selection
of transmission parameters for control response frames (e.g.
CTS and ACK).  <em>ns-3</em> follows the standard and selects the rate
of control response frames from the set of basic rates or
mandatory rates. This means that control response frames may
be sent using different rate even though the ConstantRateWifiManager
is used.  The ControlMode attribute of the ConstantRateWifiManager
is used for RTS frames only.  The rate of CTS and ACK frames are
selected according to the 802.11 standard.  However, users can still
manually add WifiMode to the basic rate set that will allow control
response frames to be sent at other rates.  Please consult the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/HOWTO_add_basic_rates_to_802.11">project wiki</a> on how to do this.</p>
<p>Available attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DataMode (default WifiMode::OfdmRate6Mbps): specify a mode for
all non-unicast packets</p></li>
<li><p>ControlMode (default WifiMode::OfdmRate6Mbps): specify a mode for
all ‘request’ control packets</p></li>

<h4>IdealWifiManager<a class="headerlink" href="#idealwifimanager" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The ideal rate control algorithm selects the best
mode according to the SNR of the previous packet sent.
Consider node <em>A</em> sending a unicast packet to node <em>B</em>.
When <em>B</em> successfully receives the packet sent from <em>A</em>,
<em>B</em> records the SNR of the received packet into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ns3::SnrTag</span></code>
and adds the tag to an ACK back to <em>A</em>.
By doing this, <em>A</em> is able to learn the SNR of the packet sent to <em>B</em>
using an out-of-band mechanism (thus the name ‘ideal’).
<em>A</em> then uses the SNR to select a transmission mode based
on a set of SNR thresholds, which was built from a target BER and
mode-specific SNR/BER curves.</p>
<p>Available attribute:</p>

<li><p>BerThreshold (default 10e-6): The maximum Bit Error Rate
that is used to calculate the SNR threshold for each mode.</p></li>

<h4>MinstrelWifiManager<a class="headerlink" href="#minstrelwifimanager" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The minstrel rate control algorithm is a rate control algorithm originated from
madwifi project.  It is currently the default rate control algorithm of the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Minstrel keeps track of the probability of successfully sending a frame of each available rate.
Minstrel then calculates the expected throughput by multiplying the probability with the rate.
This approach is chosen to make sure that lower rates are not selected in favor of the higher
rates (since lower rates are more likely to have higher probability).</p>
<p>In minstrel, roughly 10 percent of transmissions are sent at the so-called lookaround rate.
The goal of the lookaround rate is to force minstrel to try higher rate than the currently used rate.</p>

<h4>Ack policy selection<a class="headerlink" href="#ack-policy-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Since the introduction of the IEEE 802.11e amendment, multiple acknowledgment policies
are available, which are coded in the Ack Policy subfield in the QoS Control field of
QoS Data frames (see Section 9.2.4.5.4 of the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard). For instance,
an A-MPDU can be sent with the <em>Normal Ack or Implicit Block Ack Request</em> policy, in which
case the receiver replies with a Normal Ack or a Block Ack depending on whether the A-MPDU
contains a single MPDU or multiple MPDUs, or with the <em>Block Ack</em> policy, in which case
the receiver waits to receive a Block Ack Request in the future to which it replies with
a Block Ack.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WifiAckPolicySelector</span></code> is the abstract base class introduced to provide an interface
for multiple ack policy selectors. Currently, the default ack policy selector is
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ConstantWifiAckPolicySelector</span></code>.</p>

<h4>ConstantWifiAckPolicySelector<a class="headerlink" href="#constantwifiackpolicyselector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ConstantWifiAckPolicySelector</span></code> allows to determine which acknowledgment policy
to use depending on the value of its attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>UseExplicitBar: used to determine the ack policy to use when a response is needed from
the recipient and the current transmission includes multiple frames (A-MPDU) or there are
frames transmitted previously for which an acknowledgment is needed. If this attribute is
true, the <em>Block Ack</em> policy is used. Otherwise, the <em>Implicit Block Ack Request</em> policy is used.</p></li>
<li><p>BaThreshold: used to determine when the originator of a Block Ack agreement needs to
request a response from the recipient. A value of zero means that a response is requested
at every frame transmission. Otherwise, a non-zero value (less than or equal to 1) means
that a response is requested upon transmission of a frame whose sequence number is distant
at least BaThreshold multiplied by the transmit window size from the starting sequence
number of the transmit window.</p></li>

<p>802.11ax mode supports OBSS PD spatial reuse feature.
OBSS PD stands for Overlapping Basic Service Set Preamble-Detection.

<h4>OBSS PD Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#obss-pd-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ObssPdAlgorithm</span></code> is the base class of OBSS PD algorithms.
It implements the common functionalities. First, it makes sure the necessary callbacks are setup.
Second, when a PHY reset is requested by the algorithm, it performs the computation to determine the TX power
restrictions and informs the PHY object.</p>
<p>The PHY keeps tracks of incoming requests from the MAC to get access to the channel.
If a request is received and if PHY reset(s) indicating TX power limitations occured
before a packet was transmitted, the next packet to be transmitted will be sent with
a reduced power. Otherwise, no TX power restrictions will be applied.</p>

<h4>Constant OBSS PD Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#constant-obss-pd-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Constant OBSS PD algorithm is a simple OBSS PD algorithm implemented in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ConstantObssPdAlgorithm</span></code> class.</p>
<p>Once a HE preamble and its header have been received by the PHY, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ConstantObssPdAlgorithm::</span>
<span class="pre">ReceiveHeSig</span></code> is triggered.
The algorithm then checks whether this is an OBSS frame by comparing its own BSS color with the BSS color of the received preamble.
If this is an OBSS frame, it compares the received RSSI with its configured OBSS PD level value. The PHY then gets reset to IDLE
state in case the received RSSI is lower than that constant OBSS PD level value, and is informed about a TX power restrictions.</p>
<p>Note: since our model is based on a single threshold, the PHY only supports one restricted power level.</p>

<h4>Modifying Wifi model<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-wifi-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Modifying the default wifi model is one of the common tasks when performing research.
We provide an overview of how to make changes to the default wifi model in this section.
Depending on your goal, the common tasks are (in no particular order):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Creating or modifying the default Wi-Fi frames/headers by making changes to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wifi-mac-header.*</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>MAC low modification. For example, handling new/modified control frames (think RTS/CTS/ACK/Block ACK),
making changes to two-way transaction/four-way transaction.  Users usually make changes to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mac-low.*</span></code> to accomplish this.  Handling of control frames is performed in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MacLow::ReceiveOk</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>MAC high modification. For example, handling new management frames (think beacon/probe),
beacon/probe generation.  Users usually make changes to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">regular-wifi-mac.*</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">infrastructure-wifi-mac.*</span></code>,``sta-wifi-mac.*``, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ap-wifi-mac.*</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adhoc-wifi-mac.*</span></code> to accomplish this.</p></li>
<li><p>Wi-Fi queue management.  The files <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">txop.*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qos-txop.*</span></code> are of interest for this task.</p></li>
<li><p>Channel access management.  Users should modify the files <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">channel-access-manager.*</span></code>, which grant access to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Txop</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QosTxop</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fragmentation and RTS threholds are handled by Wi-Fi remote station manager.  Note that Wi-Fi remote
station manager simply indicates if fragmentation and RTS are needed.  Fragmentation is handled by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Txop</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QosTxop</span></code> while RTS/CTS transaction is handled by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MacLow</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Modifying or creating new rate control algorithms can be done by creating a new child class of Wi-Fi remote
station manager or modifying the existing ones.</p></li>

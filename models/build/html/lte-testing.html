<p>To test and validate the ns-3 LTE module, several test suites are provided which are integrated with the ns-3 test framework.
To run them, you need to have configured the build of the simulator in this way:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./waf configure --enable-tests --enable-modules<span class="o">=</span>lte --enable-examples
$ ./test.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above will run not only the test suites belonging to the LTE module, but also those belonging to all the other ns-3 modules on which the LTE module depends. See the ns-3 manual for generic information on the testing framework.</p>
<p>You can get a more detailed report in HTML format in this way:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./test.py -w results.html
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After the above command has run, you can view the detailed result for each test by opening the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results.html</span></code> with a web browser.</p>
<p>You can run each test suite separately using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./test.py -s test-suite-name

<h4>SINR calculation in the Downlink<a class="headerlink" href="#sinr-calculation-in-the-downlink" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-downlink-sinr</span></code>
checks that the SINR calculation in
downlink is performed correctly. The SINR in the downlink is calculated for each
RB assigned to data transmissions by dividing the power of the
intended signal from the considered eNB by the sum of the noise power plus all
the transmissions on the same RB coming from other eNBs (the interference
signals):</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/28484b1073fba52353d75545588781fdb05043f6.png" alt="\gamma = \frac{ P_\mathrm{signal} }{ P_\mathrm{noise} + \sum P_\mathrm{interference} }"/></p>
</div><p>In general, different signals can be active during different periods
of time. We define a <em>chunk</em> as the time interval between any two
events of type either start or end of a waveform. In other words, a
chunk identifies a time interval during which the set of active
waveforms does not change. Let <img class="math" src="_images/math/5aa339d4daf45a810dda332e3c80a0698e526e04.png" alt="i"/> be the generic chunk,

</div><p>The test suite checks that the above calculation is performed
correctly in the simulator. The test vectors are obtained offline by
an Octave script that implements the above equation, and that
recreates a number of random transmitted signals and interference
signals that mimic a scenario where an UE is trying to decode a signal
from an eNB while facing interference from other eNBs. The test passes
if the calculated values are equal to the test vector within a
tolerance of <img class="math" src="_images/math/df048aa37b785a8082d34feb1e133dd438e73fa3.png" alt="10^{-7}"/>. The tolerance is meant to account for

uplink is performed correctly. This test suite is identical to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-downlink-sinr</span></code> described in the previous section, with the
difference than both the signal and the interference now refer to
transmissions by the UEs, and reception is performed by the eNB.
This test suite recreates a number of random transmitted signals and
interference signals to mimic a scenario where an eNB is trying to
decode the signal from several UEs simultaneously (the ones in the
cell of the eNB) while facing interference from other UEs (the ones
belonging to other cells).</p>

scenario with a single eNB and a single UE. Different test cases are created
corresponding to different SNR values perceived by the UE. The aim of the test
is to check that in each test case the chosen MCS corresponds to some known

model described in Section <a class="reference internal" href="lte-design.html#sec-lte-amc"><span class="std std-ref">Adaptive Modulation and Coding</span></a> for the calculation of the

<h4>Inter-cell Interference Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#inter-cell-interference-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <cite>lte-interference</cite> provides system tests recreating an
inter-cell interference scenario with two eNBs, each having a single
UE attached to it and employing Adaptive Modulation and Coding both in
the downlink and in the uplink. The topology of the scenario
is depicted in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lte-interference-test-scenario"><span class="std std-ref">Topology for the inter-cell interference test</span></a>. The
<img class="math" src="_images/math/3ae609da43d4b08e38f5d39c0e6b1334d3c6bbd9.png" alt="d_1"/> parameter represents the distance of each UE to the eNB it
is attached to, whereas the <img class="math" src="_images/math/cc01b82d36d02dbb2f81204ce239408227e1f242.png" alt="d_2"/> parameter represent the
interferer distance. We note that the scenario topology is such that
the interferer distance is the same for uplink and downlink; still,
the actual interference power perceived will be different, because of
the different propagation loss in the uplink and downlink
bands. Different test cases are obtained by varying the <img class="math" src="_images/math/3ae609da43d4b08e38f5d39c0e6b1334d3c6bbd9.png" alt="d_1"/>

<h4>UE Measurements Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#ue-measurements-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <cite>lte-ue-measurements</cite> provides system tests recreating an
inter-cell interference scenario identical of the one defined for
<cite>lte-interference</cite> test-suite. However, in this test the quantities to be
tested are represented by RSRP and RSRQ measurements performed by the UE in two
different points of the stack: the source, which is UE PHY layer, and the
destination, that is the eNB RRC.</p>
<p>The test vectors are obtained by the use of a dedicated octave script (available
in <cite>src/lte/test/reference/lte-ue-measurements.m</cite>), which does the link budget
calculations (including interference) corresponding to the topology of each
test case, and outputs the resulting RSRP and RSRQ. The obtained values are then
used for checking the correctness of the UE Measurements at PHY layer. After
that, they have to be converted according to 3GPP formatting for the purpose of
checking their correctness at eNB RRC level.</p>

<div class="section" id="ue-measurement-configuration-tests">
<h4>UE measurement configuration tests<a class="headerlink" href="#ue-measurement-configuration-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Besides the previously mentioned test suite, there are 3 other test suites for
testing UE measurements: <cite>lte-ue-measurements-piecewise-1</cite>,
<cite>lte-ue-measurements-piecewise-2</cite>, and <cite>lte-ue-measurements-handover</cite>. These
test suites are more focused on the reporting trigger procedure, i.e. the
correctness of the implementation of the event-based triggering criteria is
verified here.</p>
<p>In more specific, the tests verify the <em>timing</em> and the <em>content</em> of each
measurement reports received by eNodeB. Each test case is an stand-alone LTE
simulation and the test case will pass if measurement report(s) only occurs at
the prescribed time and shows the correct level of RSRP (RSRQ is not verified at
the moment).</p>
<div class="section" id="piecewise-configuration">
<h5>Piecewise configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#piecewise-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The piecewise configuration aims to test a particular UE measurements
configuration. The simulation script will setup the corresponding measurements
configuration to the UE, which will be active throughout the simulation.</p>
<p>Since the reference values are precalculated by hands, several assumptions are
made to simplify the simulation. Firstly, the channel is only affected by path
loss model (in this case, Friis model is used). Secondly, the ideal RRC protocol
is used, and layer 3 filtering is disabled. Finally, the UE moves in a
predefined motion pattern between 4 distinct spots, as depicted in Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ue-meas-piecewise-motion"><span class="std std-ref">UE movement trace throughout the simulation in piecewise configuration</span></a> below. Therefore the fluctuation of the
measured RSRP can be determined more easily.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">UE movement trace throughout the simulation in piecewise configuration</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>The motivation behind the <em>“teleport”</em> between the predefined spots is to
introduce drastic change of RSRP level, which will guarantee the triggering of
entering or leaving condition of the tested event. By performing drastic
changes, the test can be run within shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ue-meas-piecewise-a1"><span class="std std-ref">Measured RSRP trace of an example Event A1 test case in piecewise
configuration</span></a> below shows the measured RSRP after
layer 1 filtering by the PHY layer during the simulation with a piecewise
configuration. Because layer 3 filtering is disabled, these are the exact values
used by the UE RRC instance to evaluate reporting trigger procedure. Notice that
the values are refreshed every 200 ms, which is the default filtering period of
PHY layer measurements report. The figure also shows the time when entering and
leaving conditions of an example instance of Event A1 (serving cell becomes
better than threshold) occur during the simulation.</p>

<p>Piecewise configuration is used in two test suites of UE measurements. The first
one is <cite>lte-ue-measurements-piecewise-1</cite>, henceforth Piecewise test #1, which
simulates 1 UE and 1 eNodeB. The other one is <cite>lte-ue-measurements-piecewise-2</cite>,
which has 1 UE and 2 eNodeBs in the simulation.</p>
<p>Piecewise test #1 is intended to test the event-based criteria which are not
dependent on the existence of a neighboring cell. These criteria include Event
A1 and A2. The other events are also briefly tested to verify that they are
still working correctly (albeit not reporting anything) in the absence of any
neighboring cell. Table <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-ue-meas-piecewise-1"><span class="std std-ref">UE measurements test scenarios using piecewise configuration #1</span></a> below lists the
scenarios tested in piecewise test #1.</p>

<p>Other events such as Event A3, A4, and A5 depend on measurements of neighbouring
cell, so they are more thoroughly tested in Piecewise test #2. The simulation
places the nodes on a straight line and instruct the UE to <em>“jump”</em> in a similar
manner as in Piecewise test #1. Handover is disabled in the simulation, so the
role of serving and neighbouring cells do not switch during the simulation.

<p>One note about the tests with time-to-trigger, they are tested using 3 different
values of time-to-trigger: <em>short</em> (shorter than report interval), <em>long</em>
(shorter than the filter measurement period of 200 ms), and <em>super</em> (longer than
200 ms). The first two ensure that time-to-trigger evaluation always use the
latest measurement reports received from PHY layer. While the last one is
responsible for verifying time-to-trigger cancellation, for example when a
measurement report from PHY shows that the entering/leaving condition is no
longer true before the first trigger is fired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handover-configuration">
<h5>Handover configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#handover-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The purpose of the handover configuration is to verify whether UE measurement
configuration is updated properly after a successful handover takes place. For
this purpose, the simulation will construct 2 eNodeBs with different UE
measurement configuration, and the UE will perform handover from one cell to
another. The UE will be located on a straight line between the 2 eNodeBs, and
the handover will be invoked manually. The duration of each simulation is
2 seconds (except the last test case) and the handover is triggered exactly at
halfway of simulation.</p>
<p>The <cite>lte-ue-measurements-handover</cite> test suite covers various types of
configuration differences. The first one is the difference in report interval,
e.g. the first eNodeB is configured with 480 ms report interval, while the
second eNodeB is configured with 240 ms report interval. Therefore, when the UE
performed handover to the second cell, the new report interval must take effect.
As in piecewise configuration, the timing and the content of each measurement
report received by the eNodeB will be verified.</p>
<p>Other types of differences covered by the test suite are differences in event
and differences in threshold/offset. Table <a class="reference internal" href="#tab-ue-meas-handover"><span class="std std-ref">UE measurements test scenarios using handover configuration</span></a> below

within a relative tolerance of 0.1. This tolerance is needed to account for the
transient behavior at the beginning of the simulation (e.g., CQI feedback is
only available after a few subframes) as well as for the accuracy of the
estimator of the average throughput performance over the chosen simulation time
(0.4s). This choice of the simulation time is justified by the need to
follow the ns-3 guidelines of keeping the total execution time of the test
suite low, in spite of the high number of test cases. In any case, we note that
a lower value of the tolerance can be used when longer simulations are

known reference throughput up to a given tolerance. The expected
behavior of the PF scheduler when all UEs have the same SNR is that
each UE should get an equal fraction of the throughput obtainable by a
single UE when using all the resources. We calculate the reference
throughput value by dividing the throughput achievable by a single UE
at the given SNR by the total number of UEs.

scheduler allocates all RBGs to the first UE defined in script. This is because
the current FDMT and TDMT implementation always select the first UE to serve when there are
multiple UEs having the same SNR value. We calculate the reference

<p>In the first test case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-tdbet-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-fdbet-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code>,
the UEs are all placed at the same distance from the eNB, and hence all placed in order to
have the same SNR. Different test cases are implemented by using a different SNR value and
a different number of UEs. The test consists on checking that the obtained throughput performance
matches with the known reference throughput up to a given tolerance. In long term, the expected
behavior of both TD-BET and FD-BET when all UEs have the same SNR is that each UE should get an
equal throughput. However, the exact throughput value of TD-BET and FD-BET in this test case is not
the same.</p>
<p>When all UEs have the same SNR, TD-BET can be seen as a specific case of PF where achievable rate equals
to 1. Therefore, the throughput obtained by TD-BET is equal to that of PF. On the other hand, FD-BET performs
very similar to the round robin (RR) scheduler in case of that all UEs have the same SNR and the number of UE( or RBG)
is an integer multiple of the number of RBG( or UE). In this case, FD-BET always allocate the same number of RBGs
to each UE. For example, if eNB has 12 RBGs and there are 6 UEs, then each UE will get 2 RBGs in each TTI.
Or if eNB has 12 RBGs and there are 24 UEs, then each UE will get 2 RBGs per two TTIs. When the number of
UE (RBG) is not an integer multiple of the number of RBG (UE), FD-BET will not follow the RR behavior because
it will assigned different number of RBGs to some UEs, while the throughput of each UE is still the same.</p>
<p>The second category of tests aims at verifying the fairness of the both TD-BET and FD-BET schedulers in a more realistic
simulation scenario where the UEs have a different SNR (constant for the whole simulation). In this case,
both scheduler should give the same amount of averaged throughput to each user.</p>
<p>Specifically, for TD-BET, let <img class="math" src="_images/math/d907a3c4e1257ec91ba2b8475cc048392650b648.png" alt="F_i"/> be the fraction of time allocated to user i in total simulation time,

<h4>Token Band Fair Queue scheduler performance<a class="headerlink" href="#token-band-fair-queue-scheduler-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Test suites <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-fdtbfq-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-tdtbfq-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code> create different
test cases for testing three key features of TBFQ scheduler: traffic policing, fairness and traffic
balance. Constant Bit Rate UDP traffic is used in both downlink and uplink in all test cases.
The packet interval is set to 1ms to keep the RLC buffer non-empty. Different traffic rate is
achieved by setting different packet size. Specifically, two classes of flows are created in the
test suites:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Homogeneous flow: flows with the same token generation rate and packet arrival rate</p></li>
<li><p>Heterogeneous flow: flows with different packet arrival rate, but with the same token generation rate</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In test case 1 verifies traffic policing and fairness features for the scenario that all UEs are
placed at the same distance from the eNB. In this case, all Ues have the same SNR value. Different
test cases are implemented by using a different SNR value and a different number of UEs. Because each
flow have the same traffic rate and token generation rate, TBFQ scheduler will guarantee the same
throughput among UEs without the constraint of token generation rate. In addition, the exact value
of UE throughput is depended on the total traffic rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>If total traffic rate &lt;= maximum throughput, UE throughput = traffic rate</p></li>
<li><p>If total traffic rate &gt; maximum throughput,  UE throughput = maximum throughput / N</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here, N is the number of UE connected to eNodeB. The maximum throughput in this case equals to the rate
that all RBGs are assigned to one UE(e.g., when distance equals 0, maximum throughput is 2196000 byte/sec).
When the traffic rate is smaller than max bandwidth, TBFQ can police the traffic by token generation rate
so that the UE throughput equals its actual traffic rate (token generation rate is set to traffic
generation rate); On the other hand, when total traffic rate is bigger than the max throughput, eNodeB
cannot forward all traffic to UEs. Therefore, in each TTI, TBFQ will allocate all RBGs to one UE due to
the large packets buffered in RLC buffer. When  a UE is scheduled in current TTI, its token counter is decreased
so that it will not be scheduled in the next TTI. Because each UE has the same traffic generation rate,
TBFQ will serve each UE in turn and only serve one UE in each TTI (both in TD TBFQ and FD TBFQ).
Therefore, the UE throughput in the second condition equals to the evenly share of maximum throughput.</p>
<p>Test case 2 verifies traffic policing and fairness features for the scenario that each UE is placed at
the different distance from the eNB. In this case, each UE has the different SNR value. Similar to test
case 1, UE throughput in test case 2 is also depended on the total traffic rate but with a different
maximum throughput. Suppose all UEs have a high traffic load. Then the traffic will saturate the RLC buffer
in eNodeB. In each TTI, after selecting one UE with highest metric, TBFQ will allocate all RBGs to this
UE due to the large RLC buffer size. On the other hand, once RLC buffer is saturated, the total throughput
of all UEs cannot increase any more. In addition, as we discussed in test case 1, for homogeneous flows
which have the same t_i and r_i, each UE will achieve the same throughput in long term. Therefore, we
can use the same method in TD BET to calculate the maximum throughput:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/d34d5a38c8404e86a786bb537b2b770b276ef0e7.png" alt="T = \frac{N}{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{R^{fb}_i} }"/></p>

for user i. <img class="math" src="_images/math/3bfb3a64189a14b2704f4610827762d5e3145114.png" alt="N"/> is the number of UE.</p>
<p>When the total traffic rate is bigger than <img class="math" src="_images/math/e8dea8254118f111b5fb20895b03528c17566f06.png" alt="T"/>, the UE throughput equals to <img class="math" src="_images/math/f4f5fee98a65554e83f0b6b6b57bce8c039656a1.png" alt="\frac{T}{N}"/> . Otherwise, UE throughput
equals to its traffic generation rate.</p>
<p>In test case 3, three flows with different traffic rate are created. Token generation rate for each
flow is the same and equals to the average traffic rate of three flows. Because TBFQ use a shared token
bank, tokens contributed by UE with lower traffic load can be utilized by UE with higher traffic load.
In this way, TBFQ can guarantee the traffic rate for each flow. Although we use heterogeneous flow here,
the calculation of maximum throughput is as same as that in test case 2. In calculation max throughput
of test case 2, we assume that all UEs suffer high traffic load so that scheduler always assign all RBGs
to one UE in each TTI. This assumes is also true in heterogeneous flow case. In other words, whether
those flows have the same traffic rate and token generation rate, if their traffic rate is bigger enough,
TBFQ performs as same as it in test case 2. Therefore, the maximum bandwidth in test case 3 is as
same as it in test case 2.</p>
<p>In test case 3, in some flows, token generate rate does not equal to MBR, although all flows are CBR
traffic. This is not accorded with our parameter setting rules. Actually, the traffic balance feature
is used in VBR traffic. Because different UE’s peak rate may occur in different time, TBFQ use shared
token bank to balance the traffic among those VBR traffics. Test case 3 use CBR traffic to verify this
feature. But in the real simulation, it is recommended to set token generation rate to MBR.</p>

<p>Test suites <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-pss-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code> create different test cases with a single eNB and several UEs.
In all test cases, we select PFsch in FD scheduler. Same testing results can also be obtained by using CoItA
scheduler. In addition, all test cases do not define nMux so that TD scheduler in PSS will always select half
of total UE.</p>
<p>In the first class test case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-pss-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code>, the UEs are all placed at the same distance from

by using a different TBR for each UEs. In each test cases, all UEs have the same
Target Bit Rate configured by GBR in EPS bear setting. The expected behavior of PSS is to guarantee that
each UE’s throughput at least equals its TBR if the total flow rate is blow maximum throughput. Similar
to TBFQ, the maximum throughput in this case equals to the rate that all RBGs are assigned to one UE.
When the traffic rate is smaller than max bandwidth, the UE throughput equals its actual traffic rate;
On the other hand, UE throughput equals to the evenly share of the maximum throughput.</p>
<p>In the first class of test cases, each UE has the same SNR. Therefore, the priority metric in PF scheduler will be
determined by past average throughput <img class="math" src="_images/math/4ecf033f6e91f008221774f2f6279ad6c0c912a7.png" alt="T_{j}(t)"/> because each UE has the same achievable throughput

There also exist an maximum throughput in this case. Once total traffic rate is bigger than this threshold,
there will be some UEs that cannot achieve their TBR. Because there is no fading, subband CQIs for each
RBGs frequency are the same. Therefore, in FD scheduler,in each TTI, priority metrics of UE for all RBGs
are the same. This means that FD scheduler will always allocate all RBGs to one user. Therefore, in the
maximum throughput case, PSS performs like a TD-BET. Then we have:</p>

<p>The performance of the Channel and QoS aware scheduler can be tested in the similar way to performance of
Priority Set scheduler when GBR flows are not delay sensitive by measuring if the achieved throughput at
RLC layer is close to the TBR. Having this in mind, the performance of the CQA scheduler is tested by using
the same test cases as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-pss-ff-mac-scheduler</span></code>. Additionally, in <a class="reference internal" href="lte-references.html#bbojovic2014" id="id10"><span>[Bbojovic2014]</span></a> can be found performance

<h4>Building Propagation Loss Model<a class="headerlink" href="#building-propagation-loss-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The aim of the system test is to verify the integration of the
BuildingPathlossModel with the lte module. The test exploits a set of
three pre calculated losses for generating the expected SINR at the
receiver counting the transmission and the noise powers. These SINR
values are compared with the results obtained from a LTE
simulation that uses the BuildingPathlossModel. The reference loss values are
calculated off-line with an Octave script
(/test/reference/lte_pathloss.m). Each test case passes if the
reference loss value is equal to the value calculated by the simulator
within a tolerance of <img class="math" src="_images/math/ee3f80b4ad23c990072c3a64d1fd4e264c2b4a10.png" alt="0.001"/> dB, which accounts for numerical

<h4>Physical Error Model<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-error-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-phy-error-model</span></code> generates different test cases for
evaluating both data and control error models. For what concern the data, the
test consists of six test cases with single eNB and a various number of UEs,
all having the same Radio Bearer specification. Each test is designed for
evaluating the error rate perceived by a specific TB size in order to verify
that it corresponds to the expected values according to the BLER generated for
CB size analog to the TB size. This means that, for instance, the test will
check that the performance of a TB of <img class="math" src="_images/math/3bfb3a64189a14b2704f4610827762d5e3145114.png" alt="N"/> bits is analogous to the one of
a CB size of <img class="math" src="_images/math/3bfb3a64189a14b2704f4610827762d5e3145114.png" alt="N"/> bits by collecting the performance of a user which has
been forced the generation of a such TB size according to the distance to eNB.
In order to significantly test the BLER at MAC level, we configured the Adaptive
Modulation and Coding (AMC) module, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LteAmc</span></code> class, for making it less
robust to channel conditions by using the PiroEW2010 AMC model and configuring
it to select the MCS considering a target BER of 0.03 (instead of the default
value of 0.00005). We note that these values do not reflect the actual BER,
since they come from an analytical bound which does not consider all the
transmission chain aspects; therefore the BER and BLER actually experienced at
the reception of a TB is in general different.</p>
<p>The parameters of the six test cases are reported in the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<p>The error model of PCFICH-PDCCH channels consists of 4 test cases with a single

the remaining acting as interfering ones. The errors on data are disabled in
order to verify only the ones due to erroneous decodification of PCFICH-PDCCH.
As before, the system has been forced on working in a less conservative fashion
in the AMC module for appreciating the results in border situations. The
parameters of the 4 tests cases are reported in the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

The test is performed both for Round Robin scheduler. The test passes if the measured throughput matches with the reference throughput within a relative tolerance of 0.1.

simulation scenario with one eNB node at coordinates (0,0,0) and one
UE node at coordinates (x,y,0). The eNB node is configured with an
CosineAntennaModel having given orientation and beamwidth. The UE

implementation work correctly. Both these suites work by testing RLC
instances connected to special test entities that play the role of the
MAC and of the PDCP, implementing respectively the LteMacSapProvider
and LteRlcSapUser interfaces. Different test cases (i.e., input test
vector consisting of series of primitive calls by the MAC and the
PDCP) are provided that check the behavior in the following cases:</p>
<blockquote>

<li><p>segmentation: the MAC notifies multiple TX opportunities that are smaller than the SDU
size stored in the transmission buffer, which is then to be fragmented and hence
multiple PDUs are generated;</p></li>
<li><p>concatenation: the MAC notifies a TX opportunity that is bigger than the SDU, hence
multiple SDUs are concatenated in the same PDU</p></li>
<li><p>buffer status report: a series of new SDUs notifications by the

<p>In all these cases, an output test vector is determine manually from
knowledge of the input test vector and knowledge of the expected

AM RLC due to their different behavior. Each test case passes if the
sequence of primitives triggered by the RLC instance being tested is
exactly equal to the output test vector. In particular, for each PDU
transmitted by the RLC instance, both the size and the content of the
PDU are verified to check for an exact match with the test vector.</p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-rlc-am-e2e</span></code>, which test the correct retransmission of RLC PDUs
in presence of channel losses. The test instantiates an RLC AM
transmitter and a receiver, and interposes a channel that randomly
drops packet according to a fixed loss probability. Different test
cases are instantiated using different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RngRun</span></code> values and different

<a class="reference internal" href="lte-design.html#sec-initial-cell-selection"><span class="std std-ref">Initial Cell Selection</span></a> procedure. The test is a simulation of a small
network of 2 non-CSG cells and 2 non-CSG cells. Several static UEs are then
placed at predefined locations. The UEs enter the simulation without being
attached to any cell. Initial cell selection is enabled for these UEs, so each
UE will find the best cell and attach to it by themselves.</p>
<p>At predefined check points time during the simulation, the test verifies that
every UE is attached to the right cell. Moreover, the test also ensures that the
UE is properly connected, i.e., its final state is <cite>CONNECTED_NORMALLY</cite>. Figure

<div class="section" id="handover-delays">
<h4>Handover delays<a class="headerlink" href="#handover-delays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Handover procedure consists of several message exchanges between UE, source
eNodeB, and target eNodeB over both RRC protocol and X2 interface. Test suite
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-handover-delay</span></code> verifies that this procedure consistently spends the
same amount of time.</p>
<p>The test suite will run several handover test cases. Each test case is an
individual simulation featuring a handover at a specified time in simulation.
For example, the handover in the first test case is invoked at time +0.100s,
while in the second test case it is at +0.101s. There are 10 test cases, each
testing a different subframe in LTE. Thus the last test case has the handover
at +0.109s.</p>
<p>The simulation scenario in the test cases is as follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>EPC is enabled</p></li>
<li><p>2 eNodeBs with circular (isotropic) antenna, separated by 1000 meters</p></li>
<li><p>1 static UE positioned exactly in the center between the eNodeBs</p></li>
<li><p>no application installed</p></li>
<li><p>no channel fading</p></li>
<li><p>default path loss model (Friis)</p></li>
<li><p>0.300s simulation duration</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The test case runs as follow. At the beginning of the simulation, the UE is
attached to the first eNodeB. Then at the time specified by the test case input
argument, a handover request will be explicitly issued to the second eNodeB.
The test case will then record the starting time, wait until the handover is
completed, and then record the completion time. If the difference between the
completion time and starting time is less than a predefined threshold, then the
test passes.</p>
<p>A typical handover in the current ns-3 implementation takes 4.2141 ms when using
Ideal RRC protocol model, and 19.9283 ms when using Real RRC protocol model.
Accordingly, the test cases use 5 ms and 20 ms as the maximum threshold values.
The test suite runs 10 test cases with Ideal RRC protocol model and 10 test
cases with Real RRC protocol model. More information regarding these models can
be found in Section <a class="reference internal" href="lte-design.html#sec-rrc-protocol-models"><span class="std std-ref">RRC protocol models</span></a>.</p>
<p>The motivation behind using subframes as the main test parameters is the fact
that subframe index is one of the factors for calculating RA-RNTI, which is used
by Random Access during the handover procedure. The test cases verify this
computation, utilizing the fact that the handover will be delayed when this
computation is broken. In the default simulation configuration, the handover
delay observed because of a broken RA-RNTI computation is typically 6 ms.</p>

handover decisions during simulation. The decision includes the UE which should
do the handover and the target cell where the UE should perform handover to.</p>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-handover-target</span></code> verifies that the handover algorithm is
making the right decision, in particular, in choosing the right target cell. It
consists of several short test cases for different network topology (2×2 grid
and 3×2 grid) and types of handover algorithm (the A2-A4-RSRQ handover algorithm
and the strongest cell handover algorithm).</p>
<p>Each test case is a simulation of a micro-cell environment with the following
parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>EPC is enabled</p></li>
<li><p>several circular (isotropic antenna) micro-cell eNodeBs in a rectangular grid
layout, with 130 m distance between each adjacent point</p></li>
<li><p>1 static UE, positioned close to and attached to the source cell</p></li>
<li><p>no control channel error model</p></li>
<li><p>no application installed</p></li>
<li><p>no channel fading</p></li>
<li><p>default path loss model (Friis)</p></li>
<li><p>1s simulation duration</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To trigger a handover, the test case “shutdowns” the source cell at +0.5s
simulation time. Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lte-handover-target-scenario"><span class="std std-ref">lte-handover-target test scenario in a 2×2 grid</span></a> below
illustrates the process. This is done by setting the source cell’s Tx power to
a very low value. As a result, the handover algorithm notices that the UE
deserves a handover and several neighboring cells become candidates of target
cell at the same time.</p>

computed with all TCP values are equal to expected values.</p></li>
<li><p>LteUplinkClosedLoopPowerControlAccumulatedModeTestCase test case checks Closed Loop Uplink
Power Control functionality with Closed Loop mechanism and Accumulative Mode enabled.
UE is attached to eNB and is transmitting data in Downlink and Uplink. Uplink Power Control
with Closed Loop mechanism and Accumulative Mode is enabled. UE is located 100 m from eNB and
is not changing its position. As in above test case, LteFfrSimple algorithm is used on eNB
side to set TPC values in DL-DCI messages, but in this case TPC command are set in DL-DCI
only configured number of times, and after that TPC is set to be 1, what is mapped to value
of 0 in Accumulative Mode (TS36.213 Table 5.1.1.1-2). TPC configuration in eNB is changed
every 100 ms. UE is accumulating these values and calculates Tx Power levels for all uplink
channels based on accumulated value. If computed Tx Power level is lower than minimal
UE Tx Power, UE should transmit with its minimal Tx Power. If computed Tx Power level is
higher than maximal UE Tx Power, UE should transmit with its maximal Tx Power.
Tx Power levels for PUSCH, PUCCH and SRS are traced and test passes if they are equal to
expected values.</p></li>

to check other FR algorithms in this way because they use entire cell bandwidth).
Test passes if none of not allowed RBGs are used.</p>
<p>Second type of test cases check if UE is served within proper sub-band and with proper
transmission power. In this test scenario, there are two eNBs.There are also two UEs
and each eNB is serving one.  One uses Frequency Reuse algorithm and second one does not.
Second eNB is responsible for generating interferences in whole system bandwidth.
UE served by first eNB is changing position each few second (rather slow because time is
needed to report new UE Measurements). To check which RBGs are used for this UE
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LteSimpleSpectrumPhy</span></code> is attached to Downlink Channel. It notifies when data
downlink channel transmission in cell 1 has occurred and pass signal TxPsd spectrum value
to check which RBs were used for transmission and their power level.
The same approach is applied in Uplink direction and second <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LteSimpleSpectrumPhy</span></code>
is attached to Uplink Channel. Test passes if UE served by eNB with FR algorithm
is served in DL and UL with expected RBs and with expected power level.
Test vector comprise a configuration for Strict FR, Soft FR, Soft FFR, Enhanced FFR.
Each FR algorithm is tested with all schedulers, which support FR (i.e. PF, PSS, CQA,
TD-TBFQ, FD-TBFQ). (Hard FR do not use UE measurements, so there is no point to perform
this type of test for Hard FR).</p>
<p>Test case for Distributed FFR algorithm is quite similar to above one, but since eNBs need
to exchange some information, scenario with EPC enabled and X2 interfaces is considered.
Moreover, both eNB are using Distributed FFR algorithm. There are 2 UE in first cell,
and 1 in second cell. Position of each UE is changed (rather slow because time is
needed to report new UE Measurements), to obtain different result from calculation in
Distributed FFR algorithm entities. To check which RBGs are used for UE transmission
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LteSimpleSpectrumPhy</span></code> is attached to Downlink Channel. It notifies when data
downlink channel transmission has occurred and pass signal TxPsd spectrum value
to check which RBs were used for transmission and their power level.
The same approach is applied in Uplink direction and second <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LteSimpleSpectrumPhy</span></code>
is attached to Uplink Channel.
Test passes if UE served by eNB in cell 2, is served in DL and UL with expected RBs
and with expected power level. Test vector comprise a configuration for Distributed FFR.
Test is performed with all schedulers, which support FR (i.e. PF, PSS, CQA,
TD-TBFQ, FD-TBFQ).</p>

<h4>Inter-cell Interference with FR algorithms Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#inter-cell-interference-with-fr-algorithms-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-interference-fr</span></code> is very similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-interference</span></code>.
Topology (Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-lte-interference-test-scenario"><span class="std std-ref">Topology for the inter-cell interference test</span></a>) is the same and test checks
interference level. The difference is that, in this test case Frequency Reuse algorithms
are enabled and we are checking interference level on different RBGs (not only on one).
For example, when we install Hard FR algorithm in eNbs, and first half of system bandwidth
is assigned to one eNb, and second half to second eNb, interference level should be much
lower compared to legacy scenario. The test vector comprise a set of configuration for
all available Frequency Reuse Algorithms. Test passes if calculated SINR on specific
RBs is equal to these obtained by Octave script.</p>

<h4>Carrier aggregation test<a class="headerlink" href="#carrier-aggregation-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-carrier-aggregation</span></code> is a system test program that creates different test
cases with a single eNB and several UEs, all having the same radio bearer specification. Different
test cases are implemented by using different SINR values and different numbers of UEs. eNBs and UEs
are configured to use the secondary carrier and the component carrier manager is configured to
split the data uniformly between primary and secondary carrier. The test consists of checking that
the throughput obtained over the different carriers are equal considering a given tolerance. For more
details about this test, see the section Carrier aggregation usage example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="carrier-aggregation-test-for-enb-and-ue-configuration">
<h4>Carrier aggregation test for eNB and UE configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#carrier-aggregation-test-for-enb-and-ue-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">carrier-aggregation-config-test</span></code> is a system test program, which verifies the
following two cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>When carrier aggregation is enabled and UE carriers configuration is different than the default
configuration done in LteHelper, we check that the UE(s) is configured properly once it receives
RRC Connection Reconfiguration message from eNB.</p></li>
<li><p>A user can configure 2 or more eNBs and UEs with different configuration parameters, i.e.,
each eNB and UE can have different EARFCN and Bandwidths and a UE connects to an eNB with similar DL EARFCN.
In this test, we check with CA enabled but the end results will be the same if carrier aggregation is not
enabled and we have more than one eNBs and UEs with different configurations.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since, we do not need EPC to test the configuration, this test only simulates the LTE radio access with RLC SM.
There are two test cases, Test 1 tests that the UE is configured properly after receiving RRC Connection Reconfiguration
message from the eNB, which will overwrite UE default configuration done in LteHelper for the sake of
creating PHY and MAC instances equal to the number of component carriers. Test 2 tests that every eNB or UE in a
simulation scenario can be configured with different EARFCNs and Bandwidths. For both test cases, it also counts
the number of times the hooked trace source <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SCarrierConfigured</span></code> get triggered. As, it reflects how many UEs
got attached to their respective eNB. If the count is not equal to the number of UEs in the scenario, the test fails,
which could be the result of improper UE configuration.</p>

<h4>Radio link failure Test<a class="headerlink" href="#radio-link-failure-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The test suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lte-radio-link-failure</span></code> is a system test, which tests the
radio link failure functionality using Ideal and Real RRC protocols.
In particular, it tests the following to verify the Radio link
Failure (RLF) implementation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The state and the configuration of the UE while it is connected to the eNB.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the UE while T310 timer is running at the UE.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of out-of-sync and in-synch indications received.</p></li>
<li><p>The state of the UE before the simulation end.</p></li>
<li><p>The UE context existence at the eNB before the simulation end.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This test simulates only one static UE with EPC performing downlink and uplink
communication in the following two scenarios:</p>
<div class="section" id="one-enb-using-ideal-and-real-rrc">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">RLF scenario with one eNB</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id28" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>In this scenario, the UE is initially placed near to the eNB, and on the
following instances above conditions are verified against the expected outcome.</p>
<p><strong>At 0.3 sec:</strong>  It verifies that the UE is well connected, i.e., it is in
“CONNECTED_NORMALLY” state, and is attached to the eNB with cell id 1. It also
checks for the match between the configuration of the UE and the UE context at
the eNB, e.g., IMSI, bandwidth, D/UL EARFCN, number of bearers and the bearer IDs.
The miss match would result in the test suite failure.</p>
<p><strong>At 0.4 sec:</strong> The UE jumps far away from the eNB, which causes the DL SINR at
the UE to fall below -5 dB. In result, the UE PHY after monitoring the SINR for
20 consecutive frames will send a notification to the UE RRC. In this test, the
N310 counter is set to 1; thus, the UE RRC will start the T310 (set to 1 sec)
timer upon the first notification from the PHY layer.</p>
<p><strong>At 1 sec:</strong> At this stage, it is expected that the T310 timer is still running,
and the UE is connected to the eNB.</p>
<p><strong>Upon RLF:</strong> It is expected that the UE RRC will start the T310 timer upon reaching
the configured, i.e., N310 = 1 number of notification from the eNB. The RRC will
receive no in-sync indication since the UE stays at far away position.</p>
<p><strong>Before the end of simulation:</strong>  The expected behavior is that the UE state
will be in “IDLE_CELL_SEARCH” since there is no eNB available where it has jumped.
Moreover, the deletion of the UE context from the eNB is also verified.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>In this scenario, the only difference is the addition of a second eNB near the
position where the UE jumps away. Therefore, except the outcome before the end
of the simulation, all the outcomes are similar to that we expected in the first
scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Before the end of simulation:</strong>  It is expected that the UE after the RLF will
connect to the second eNB, i.e., it will be in “CONNECTED_NORMALLY” state, and
its context exists in the second eNB.</p>
